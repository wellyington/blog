The idea of blogging using markdowns and static site generation sounded much more attractive than solutions requiring complicated setups, databases and expensive maintenance. I am documenting here the path I followed to get my first Jekyll blog.

Hi everyone, my name is Wellington and I am a computer scientist and developer based in Malaga, Spain. My expertise goes around programming, infrastructure, physics and maths. I love to get myself involved with new projects and I am constantly learning new things.
